# Background and Motivation

The current ticket email uses a simple placeholder HTML and does not match the enhanced ticket design used in the app. The goal is to update the ticket email HTML to visually match the enhanced ticket design for a more professional and branded experience.

# Key Challenges and Analysis

- Email HTML must use inline styles and static images for compatibility (no React, no Tailwind, no dynamic SVGs).
- The enhanced ticket design uses React, Tailwind, and Lucide icons, which must be adapted to static HTML/CSS and PNG/SVG icons.
- The barcode must be represented as a static image or fallback.
- The email template must be populated with dynamic ticket data.

# High-level Task Breakdown

- [x] 1. Create a static HTML email template matching the enhanced ticket design (for at least one ticket type, e.g., Music Concert).
  - Success: The HTML visually matches the app's enhanced ticket, with event image, price badge, event info, barcode, and details.
- [x] 2. Update the API route (`app/api/data-validation/route.ts`) to use the new template and populate it with real ticket data.
  - Success: The email sent to the user contains the enhanced ticket design and correct data.
- [ ] 3. (Optional) Expand to support all ticket types and/or generate a real barcode image.
  - Success: All ticket types are supported and barcode is visually accurate.

# Project Status Board

- [x] Create static HTML email template for enhanced ticket (Music Concert)
- [x] Update API route to use new template and real data
- [ ] (Optional) Expand to all ticket types and real barcode

# Current Status / Progress Tracking

- Executor completed: Email now includes user email, phone, and event details in the enhanced ticket design.
- Awaiting user confirmation: Should event details be made dynamic from the request body?

# Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

- The email now contains all requested info (email, phone, event details). Please confirm if you want the event details to be dynamic (from the request body) or if you want to keep the current sample data.

# Lessons

- Email HTML must use inline styles and static images for best compatibility.
- React/Tailwind/JSX cannot be used directly in email templates.
